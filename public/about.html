<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there, I'm Jess! Currently, I'm a student at NYU Stern, pursuing a dual 
  degree in Business and Computer Science. I've always been fascinated by the 
  intricate connection between technology and business, and the countless possibilities 
  that arise when these two fields intersect. My true passion lies in analyzing and creating 
  products that are not only innovative but also incredibly intuitive. Iâ€™m fascinated by 
  human behavior, and I enjoy diving into the minds of consumers, understanding their needs, 
  and crafting solutions that make their lives easier. I love learning new things, and as a 
  result, I have been particularly captivated by many industries including technology, 
  healthcare, the creator economy, robotics, and social impact. As I continue learning,
  my goal is to leverage my business acumen and technical expertise to create meaningful 
  solutions that drive positive change in society.</p>
